## Title

Gotta Graph’ Em All: Exploring Pokémon through Data Science

## Motivation

As lifelong Pokémon players, our team has always been curious about what
makes a Pokémon strong? How do height, weight, and type relate to
performance in battle with other players? Which Pokémon types dominate
key stats such as HP, Attack, and Speed? These are important questions
that we could only make assumptions about while growing up, whether
playing with other players online, friends at school, family members, or
just on our own. Thus, we aim to use a publicly available Pokémon
dataset that allows us to take a peek at the hidden structure behind the
Pokémon universe, and, by extension, to explore relationships between
Pokémon characteristics. Our goal is not only to explore some of these
important questions, but to enhance team-building decision-making for
the average Pokémon player.

## Final products

We aim to produce a comprehensive analytical report that incorporates
interactive visualizations through a GitHub webpage. The report will
include the following deliverables:

- Interactive charts exploring the relationship between stats, types,
  and Pokémon characteristics such as height and weight
- An effectiveness and resistance matrix for Pokémon types
- Top Pokémon performers across different stat categories, such as HP,
  Attack, Defense, Special Defense, and Speed
- Build your own Pokémon team
- Will perform a screencast presenting these findings

## Data Sources

We will use the Complete Pokémon Dataset from Kaggle, which has
information on 802 Pokémon from all seven generations. The dataset has
details on type, stats, height, weight, classification, experience
growth, and more.

- Primary Dataset:
  <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/pokemon?resource=download>

- Inspirations: <https://pokemondb.net/type>,
  <https://pokemondb.net/type/dual>, <https://pokemondb.net/pokebase>

## Planned Analyses/Visualizations/Coding Challenges

Our project focuses on understanding the relationship between Pokémon
characteristics and performance. We plan to:

- See how physical traits (height and weight) relate to base stats like
  Attack, Defense, and Speed.
- Identify which Pokémon types are strongest and weakest overall by
  comparing their average stat values.
- Visualize the distribution of stats across Pokémon generations using
  boxplots, linear regression, and heatmaps.
- See what factors (type, stats, generation) predict whether a Pokémon
  is legendary.
- Create interactive graphs using `ggplot2`, `plotly`, and `dplyr` for
  data manipulation and visualization.

## Planned timeline

- Nov 7 → Draft final data report proposal, including deliverables and
  data analysis plan
- Nov 14 → Review data proposal with reviewer to receive feedback for
  final report
- Nov 17 → Data importing, data cleaning, and data analysis
- Nov 24 → Start website development, create an effectiveness/weakness
  matrix by type, and other exploratory data analysis
- Dec 1 → Final data analysis, as well as the written report for the
  project description
