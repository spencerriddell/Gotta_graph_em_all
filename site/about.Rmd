      "<strong>From:</strong> Pastoria City, Sinnoh<br>",
      "<strong>Starter Pokémon:</strong> Chimchar<br><br>",
      
      "<strong>Background:</strong> Grew up near the Great Marsh, spending childhood studying the behaviors of local wild Pokémon and leveraging data science techniques to gain a combat advantage in Pokémon battles. By putting his Pokémon data science nerd on, he developed a talent for reading opponents’ strategies in battle and a love for statistical modeling. Based on this Pokéstats work, he spends most of his time using data to build perfect individual values (IVs) in key stats for the purpose of competitive play.<br><br>",
      
      "<strong>Training Style:</strong> Uses typing advantage and a carefully selected move-set rather than brute force to balance out weaknesses and maximize advantage in battle, even when the odds aren’t in his favor. Although Serg likes to maintain a balanced roster, he loves Fire and Fighting-type Pokémon the most.<br><br>",
      
      "<strong>Overall Goal:</strong> He wants to become a field researcher to document the diverse Pokémon ecosystem across the Sinnoh region and to uncover the secrets of the region’s legendary Pokémon, including Darkrai, Regigigas, and Heatran.<br><br>",

  "<strong>Starter Pokémon:</strong> Squirtle<br><br>",
  
  "<strong>Background:</strong> Growing up in Jubilife City, Maria was captivated by the diversity of Pokémon ecosystems around Sinnoh. From observing wild Pokémon in their habitats to studying their behavior, she developed a passion for exploration and discovery. Her curiosity and analytical mind have made her adept at uncovering patterns in both Pokémon behavior and battle strategy.<br><br>",
  
  "<strong>Training Style:</strong> Maria approaches battles like fieldwork—careful observation, strategic planning, and adaptability are key. She relies on type advantages, well-chosen move sets, and clever tactics, preferring Psychic-type Pokémon for their intelligence and versatility.<br><br>",
  
  "<strong>Overall Goal:</strong> She aspires to become a Pokémon Explorer, traveling across Sinnoh to document Pokémon habitats, study rare species, and uncover the secrets of legendary Pokémon—all while honing her skills and building a team ready for any challenge.<br><br>",

  "<strong>Program:</strong> MPH in Epidemiology<br>",
  "<strong>Certificate:</strong> Public Health & Humanitarian Action<br>",
  "<strong>From:</strong> Lumiose City, Kalos<br>",
  "<strong>Starter Pokémon:</strong> Froakie<br><br>",
  
  "<strong>Background:</strong> Eman grew up surrounded by diverse Pokémon habitats, where she became fascinated not only by patterns in strength and evolution, but also by the stories behind why certain Pokémon thrive in difficult environments. She has always approached problems with a blend of intuition and curiosity—asking deeper questions about why differences exist rather than just observing them. As she moved into epidemiology and humanitarian work, this instinctive way of seeing the world evolved into a love for research, data interpretation, and understanding populations through both numbers and narratives.<br><br>",
  
  "<strong>Training Style:</strong> Eman’s training style balances analysis with instinct. She relies on data, visual patterns, and statistical reasoning, but also trusts her ability to read context, notice subtle details, and draw meaning from the “story” behind the numbers. Whether in Pokémon battles or in research, she pairs evidence with intuition—making decisions that are both thoughtful and adaptive.<br><br>",
  
  "<strong>Overall Goal:</strong> Eman hopes to become a Pokémon population researcher who studies how environment, rarity, and external pressures shape strength and development. She aims to explore how different regions create different Pokémon outcomes, combining scientific analysis with real-world storytelling to understand the full picture.<br><br>",
