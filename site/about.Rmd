      "<strong>Background:</strong> Grew up near the Great Marsh, spending childhood studying the behaviors of local wild Pokémon and leveraging data science techniques to gain a combat advantage in Pokémon battles. By putting his Pokémon data science nerd on, he developed a talent for reading opponents’ strategies in battle and a love for statistical modeling. Based on this Pokéstats work, he spends most of his time using data to build perfect individual values (IVs) in key stats for the purpose of competitive play.<br><br>",
      
      "<strong>Training Style:</strong> Uses typing advantage and a carefully selected move-set rather than brute force to balance out weaknesses and maximize advantage in battle, even when the odds aren’t in his favor. Although Serg likes to maintain a balanced roster, he loves Fire and Fighting-type Pokémon the most.<br><br>",
