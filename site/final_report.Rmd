## Motivation

Paste or adapt from your proposal (Pokemon.Rmd). For example:
- Why this topic matters to players and analysts
- What relationships you wanted to understand (type, stats, physical attributes, performance)

## Research Questions

- RQ1: How do physical traits (height, weight) relate to base stats?
- RQ2: Which primary types tend to have stronger overall stats?
- RQ3: What predicts whether a Pokémon is legendary?
- RQ4: Can we predict primary type from base stats?

## Data

- Source: Kaggle Complete Pokémon Dataset (802 Pokémon across generations)
- Key fields used: types, HP/Attack/Defense/Sp.Atk/Sp.Def/Speed, height_m, weight_kg, generation, legendary
- Cleaning summary: see serg_working_file.Rmd for full steps; final data saved to Data/pokemon_clean.csv

## Methods (high level)

- EDA with interactive Plotly charts
- Hypothesis testing (ANOVA, t-test)
- Modeling (logistic regression for legendary status; Random Forest for type prediction)

## Results (summary)

- Summarize key statistical findings and model performance
- Reference specific figures from the EDA and Analysis pages

## Discussion

- Interpretation in gameplay context
- Limitations (e.g., data coverage, rarity/type imbalance)
- Future work (e.g., matchup matrices, team builder, generational trends)

## References

- Kaggle dataset
